# Interactive-Whiteboard

This Python script utilizes hand tracking and a webcam to create an interactive whiteboard on a virtual canvas. Leveraging the HandTracker module, the program detects hand movements and finger gestures, allowing users to draw on the canvas, change colors, adjust pen sizes, and toggle the visibility of the drawing board. Various interactive elements include buttons for selecting colors, clearing the canvas, adjusting pen sizes, and hiding/showing the drawing board. The interactive whiteboard provides an engaging and creative space where users can freely express themselves through hand gestures and virtual drawing. The script showcases the integration of computer vision and user interaction, offering a unique and dynamic way to engage with digital content.
